TOWNSFOLK

Name: Prosecutor
Ability: Each night, choose a player: If you are mad they are evil tomorrow,
learn their character that night.
Notes: A Townsfolk that can learn the roles of multiple players at the
cost of needing to act like you think they're evil, whether or not that's
true. There's a ton of balance nobs to turn here; it could be a once per game,
the storyteller could choose who instead of the player, etc.
