OUTSIDERS

Name: Ventriloquist
Ability: Player might learn something has happened, even if it hasn't
Notes: A character that allows the storyteller to fake announcements,
such as announcing day 1 of a Leviathan game when there is no announcement, or
announcing the Fearmonger has chosen a new victim even after the Fearmonger is
dead.

as a Traveller.

who they are.
